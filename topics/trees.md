# Trees

This is a more advanced topic that builds especially on [Linked Lists](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/wwcsf-algos/blob/master/topics/linked-lists.md). We recommend that you get comfortable with Linked Lists before tackling trees.

## Resources

### 1. Basics and terminology
* [Harvard CS50 2019 Data Structures lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IrUAqYKjIA&t=4104s) You can skip ahead to 1:09:32 for trees, but I recommend watching the lecture from the beginning. The language is C, but the explanation and examples don't depend on a knowledge of C. 
* Helpful list of terms and definitions from wikiversity: https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/Trees_and_Graphs
* Another useful [resource](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/tree_data_structure.htm) for trees
* Chapter 6,7 and 8 in this [resource](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/DSA/dsa.pdf) is also good.           

    
    
### 2. Important procedures: traversal, heaps, search, etc.
* [William Fiset's youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDfGc8rbQ0_58oEZQVtvoIc) explaining tree topics and algorithms. Not language specific.
* [Trees](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/Trees/toctree.html)  from _Python DS_ by Brad Miller and David Ranum, code examples in Python
* [Binary Search Trees](http://greenteapress.com/thinkdast/html/thinkdast014.html) from _Think Data Structures_  by Allen B. Downey, code examples in Java
